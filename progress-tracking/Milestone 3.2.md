# Milestone 3.2: Service Booking & Workshop Operations

**Service Booking & Parts Request:**
[ ] `POST /api/bookings` - Allow a customer to book a new service appointment.
[ ] `GET /api/bookings` - Allow ADMINs or MECHANICs to view all appointments.
[ ] `POST /api/bookings/{bookingId}/request-part` - Allow a mechanic to request a part for a job.
[ ] **Inventory Logic:** Ensure the parts request automatically deducts the quantity from the inventory.
