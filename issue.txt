issue:

logged in as customer -> view cart -> "cart is empty" -> click browse parts button -> add 2 items in cart -> click back to dashboard -> view shopping cart -> click proceed to checkout -> order placed successfully -> avoid clicking upload payment receipt, instead try click continue shopping -> click back to dashboard again -> current url ("http://localhost:3000/dashboard/order-success?orderId=4") with a ui error "Error: Order information not found. Please check your orders in your profile." -> click go to dashboard -> click shopping cart -> shopping cart is empty (understandable, but how customer wants to view orders with pending payments?)

we can ignore "how customer wants to view orders with pending payments?" in this branch first. we're going to sort it out later.
